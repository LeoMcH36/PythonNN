# PythonNN
Simple Neural network with the ability to differentiate between spanish and english. 

Created to test my knowledge and get back into programming after a nearly 3 month break.
I didnt use any external ML or NN librarys. Just my own knowledge of forward passing and back propagation.

Not completlely finished



achieved 68% pre tuning

 **Plans** Currently Everything is functional, I need more data , better data and i will also tune the parameters further


 **To run just run the neuralNetwork.py file**
