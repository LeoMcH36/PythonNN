# PythonNN
Simple Neural network with the ability to differentiate between spanish and english. 

Created to test my knowledge and get back into programming after a nearly 3 month break.
I didnt use any external ML or NN librarys. Just my own knowledge of forward passing and back propagation.


**This model needs a lot more and a lot better data, it could have much better features as well i'm aware


 **To run just run the neuralNetwork.py file**
